** Surge Impedance
#+NAME: eqSurgeImpedance
\begin{align}
Z_0= \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
\end{align}
Where L and C are the line capacitance and reactance. [fn::since this is given as a fraction it doesn't matter whether this is given as a per unit length value or as a total value]
** Electrical Length
This is effectively a measure of the amount of wavelengths of a particular frequency fit into a length of conductor. Electrical length is given by Equation ref:eqElectricalLength.
#+NAME: eqElectricalLength
\begin{align}
\theta=\omega\sqrt{LC}
\end{align}
A value of \(\theta = 2\pi\) would imply a single wavelength, however even for very long lines, typically values are \(\ll 2\pi\).
** Open Circuit Transmission line Voltage distribution
Voltage distribution along the line is given by Equation ref:eqVoltageDist:
#+NAME: eqVoltageDist
\begin{align}
V(x)= V_s \frac{\cos{(\theta(1-x/a))}}
{\cos{\theta}}
\end{align}
Where x is defined as the distance from the sending end, a is the line length, and \(V_s\) is the phasor voltage at the sending end. setting \(x=a\) and expression is derived for the voltage at the receiving end.
#+NAME: eqOpenCircuitRecEndV
\begin{align}
V_r =V(x=a) = \frac{V_s}{\cos{\theta}}
\end{align}
Since we assume that typical values of angle are \(\ll2\pi\) we know that as \theta grows we expect \(V_r\) to increase from being exactly equal to \(V_s\) to a value \(\ge V_s\)
** Matched Impedance Transmission line Voltage Distribution
The voltage profile for a line terminated in a matched impedance \(Z_0\) would yield a perfectly flat voltage distribution i.e. \(V(x) = V_s = V_r\). For any impedance greater than the surge impedance \((Z_0)\)  the voltage will tend to rise at the end of the transmission line while lower load impedance will cause the voltage profile in the line to sag leading to lower \(V_r\). [fn:: this can be expressed also as higher voltage for loads lower than the surge load where \(surge\: load \propto 1/Z_l\)]
*** Reactive Power Consumption
When the load impedance is matched to the surge impedance \((Z_0=Z_l)\), the reactive power consumption of the line is zero. When \(Z_l > Z_0\) the line generates reactive power whereas when \( Z_l < Z_0\) the line consumes reactive power.

#+RESULTS:
[[file:voltDistResults_Matched.png]]
From Figure ref:figVtrans_Matched we see that the voltage distribution along the line is indeed very flat deviating to a maximum of \approx2% deviation from the sending end voltage. In theory there should be no deviation from the sending end voltage however this deviation may be due to the terminating impedance being slightly lower than the sending end due to tolerance. The outlier
*** Phase change - Matched termination
Phase angle for the model line with matched termination is shown in Table ref:tabPhaseShift_Matched. These are measured relative to the sending end voltage. Taking the sending end voltage as the origin, with the measurements of phase angel shown below it can be seen that the phase angle along the line varies linearly with the electrical length since the measurement point of the end point is by definition twice the electrical length of the mid point and has twice the phase-shift. It is also noted that the total phase shift along the line is roughly equal to the electrical length of the line.

** Less than Matched Impedance (Part e)
*** Voltage Distribution - Less than Matched
The recorded voltage profile for a termination impedance << z_{0} is presented in table ref:tabLessThanMatchedImpedance. The voltages normalised against sending end are plotted against 1 point in Figure ref:figVtrans_LessThanMatched. Here the voltage again tends to fall along the line similar to the closed-circuit case, however with a significantly lower magnitude. The voltage profile seems to display an exponential decay.

Phase angle measurements for a line terminated with less than the characteristic impedance at them middle and end of the line are shown in Table ref:tabPhaseShift_LessThanZ0.

*** Voltage Distribution
The line was exited with the same voltage magnitude as section C however with twice the excitation frequency of the prior experiment (1400Hz). The measurements of voltage along with the theoretical voltage distribution calculated according to Equation ref:eqVoltageDist are tabulated in Table ref:tabVoltDistResults_doubleFreq. The measured and actual voltage distribution on the line is shown in Figure ref:figVTransmissionLineDoubleFreq.

From Figure ref:figVTransmissionLineDoubleFreq  we see a very similar curve to section C (Figure ref:vTransmissionLine) however this time the receiving end voltage has risen in to ~2.11\times the sending end voltage, while for the half length line this was only \approx1.15\times. This finding shows the nonlinearity in the relationship between electrical length \theta and  received voltage eluded to in Equation ref:eqVoltageDist. As is section C the voltage distribution predicted by Equation ref:eqVoltageDist match the measured results closely.

[[file:vTransmissionLine_OcDoubleFreq.png]]

The theoretical and measured voltage distribution curves in Figure ref:vTransmissionLine match closely implying that the measurements are in agreement with Equation ref:eqVoltageDist.
*** Phase change along the line
The measured phase-shift of the voltage  along the transmission line relative to the sending end voltage for the centre and receiving end of the line are shown in Table ref:tabPhaseShift_DoubleFreq. As with section C there is no phase-shift observed along the line.
